> This project’s goal is to make you discover, through a few small challenges, cyber security in a few various fields.

> The methods you are about to use, all more or less complicated, will present to you computer science under a different light.
>
> In the course of this project, you will most probably encounter some difficulties: let’s be clear, these difficulties, you will have to overcome them on your own. Your approach to these various tests will have to come from YOU. The point here is to make you develop a certain logic that you will have to follow through. Before asking for help, ask yourself if you have really thought through of everything.
